On running the code, it will ask for the following input values:
Enter the number of roots (n): 
Enter the minimum number of roots required (k): 
Enter base and value for root 1: 
Enter base and value for root 2: 
Enter base and value for root 3: 
Enter base and value for root 4: 
After giving the input the output will appear as:
The constant term c of the polynomial is: [calculated_value]

For Test Case 1:-
Enter the number of roots (n): 4
Enter the minimum number of roots required (k): 3
Enter base and value for root 1: 10 4
Enter base and value for root 2: 2 111
Enter base and value for root 3: 10 12
Enter base and value for root 4: 4 213
Output:
The constant term c of the polynomial is: 3
For Test Case 2:-
Enter the number of roots (n): 9
Enter the minimum number of roots required (k): 6
Enter base and value for root 1: 10 28735619723837
Enter base and value for root 2: 16 1A228867F0CA
Enter base and value for root 3: 12 32811A4AA0B7B
Enter base and value for root 4: 11 917978721331A
Enter base and value for root 5: 16 1A22886782E1
Enter base and value for root 6: 10 28735619654702
Enter base and value for root 7: 14 71AB5070CC4B
Enter base and value for root 8: 9 122662581541670
Enter base and value for root 9: 8 642121030037605
The constant term c of the polynomial is: 2.8735619723864E13
